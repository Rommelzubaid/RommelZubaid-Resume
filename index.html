        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business AdministrationðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Rommel Zubaid and I am an undergraduate student at University of California, Riverside. I am currently pursuing my Bachelors of Science in Business Economics, however, I plan to switch to Pre-Business Administration with a concentration in either accounting or marketing. Business is something that I grew up around and it is what I have decided as the best career path for me. Both my parents, have their Masters in Business Administration and it is what inspired me to strive to get mine. My parents are in real estate and that is the field I plan to go into as well. They do more residential real estate, but I plan to do more commercial. In terms of business management, I have plenty of experience with managing inventory, finance and bookkeeping, making employee files and uploading them to payroll, and many more.<br><br>

        A few hobbies I enjoy are working out and photography. Growing up I wasnâ€™t the most athletic kid. To be frank, I hated sports in the earlier stages of my life. It wasnâ€™t until high school where I took a health class and that sparked my interest in wanting to be the best version of myself. That energy took me into the gym for the first time where I picked up a set of dumbbells and never looked back. Fast forward a few years later, the gym is the part of my day that I look forward to the most. I try to go six days out of the week, however, sometimes life hits you hard and you canâ€™t make a day or maybe even longer. For me even if I cut it short, I still go because it has become my outlet. It sounds strange but itâ€™s kind of my therapy now. It wasnâ€™t until recently where I started photography. With the pandemic leaving me stuck at home, I ventured out of my comfort zone and explored new hobbies. I ended up purchasing a camera and had zero idea on how to use it. With the help of YouTube and other online tools, I ended up becoming a self taught photographer. I know that I may not be the best, but one thing that the pandemic has taught me, is that there are tons of people who want what you want, you have to outwork every single one of them. With this mindset, I practiced day in and out and eventually started taking senior portraits for a few people at my high school which turned into college graduates which turned into rappers and other artists<br><br>

        A few of my goals are to start off with residential real estate flips to acquire the liquidity to purchase a commercial real estate business like a hotel or a gas station. I was to own at least three within the next 10 years. Another goal I want to make is a religious goal. With everything going on, it is hard to practice my faith, but I want to dedicate 5-10 minutes daily for prayer.
